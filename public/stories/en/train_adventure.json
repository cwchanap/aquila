Twenty-eight—neither young nor old, neither success nor failure. Like this last train, stuck right before the terminus."

Head bowed, she remains absorbed in her private world. The college students and the posturing Glasses Guy pile in too, loud at the far end. The chime sounds, the doors close, and the train pulls away. City lights streak backward and blur. He has no idea that the train carrying him away from the familiar city is charting a path toward an unexpected fate."
