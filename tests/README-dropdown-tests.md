# Dropdown Functionality Tests

## Overview

This document describes the consolidated dropdown test suite for the UserStatus component in the Aquila gaming application.

## Test File: `dropdown-functionality.spec.ts`

### Consolidation Summary

The dropdown tests have been aggregated from multiple redundant test files:
- ❌ `dropdown-debug.spec.ts` (removed)
- ❌ `dropdown-simulation.spec.ts` (removed)
- ❌ `dropdown-verification.spec.ts` (removed)
- ❌ `dropdown-with-user.spec.ts` (removed)

All functionality has been consolidated into a single comprehensive test file.

### Test Cases

#### 1. `comprehensive dropdown functionality test`
**Purpose**: End-to-end testing of dropdown functionality with real application context
**Features Tested**:
- ✅ Z-index fix verification (button clickability)
- ✅ Authentication state detection
- ✅ Dropdown simulation for testing
- ✅ Open/close functionality
- ✅ Menu item visibility and interactions
- ✅ Navigation testing
- ✅ Outside click behavior

#### 2. `test dropdown with different viewport sizes`
**Purpose**: Responsive design testing
**Features Tested**:
- ✅ Mobile viewport (375×667)
- ✅ Tablet viewport (768×1024)
- ✅ Desktop viewport (1920×1080)
- ✅ UI element positioning across viewports

#### 3. `validate dropdown structure and styles`
**Purpose**: Isolated functionality testing without server dependency
**Features Tested**:
- ✅ Dropdown HTML structure
- ✅ CSS class management
- ✅ JavaScript event handling
- ✅ Animation states
- ✅ Gaming design styling

### Key Improvements

1. **Eliminated Redundancy**: Removed 4 duplicate test files covering similar functionality
2. **Server Independence**: Added standalone test that works without running development server
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Single test covers all aspects from z-index fixes to responsive design
4. **Better Error Handling**: Improved timeout handling and error reporting
5. **Gaming Design Validation**: Tests validate the gaming-inspired visual novel aesthetic

### Test Configuration

Tests use the standard Playwright configuration:
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:5090` (from `playwright.config.ts`)
- **Relative URLs**: Tests use `/en/` instead of absolute URLs
- **Global Setup**: Uses `global-setup.ts` for test environment preparation

### Technical Details

#### Z-Index Fix Validation
The tests specifically verify that the z-index conflicts have been resolved:
- Main content containers no longer block pointer events
- UserStatus component properly elevated to `z-50`
- All interactive elements are clickable

#### Gaming Design Validation
Tests verify the gaming-inspired ocean visual novel design:
- Gaming fonts (Orbitron, Exo 2, Rajdhani)
- Glassmorphism effects with backdrop blur
- Ocean-themed color scheme (blues and cyans)
- Enhanced hover animations and transitions

#### Responsive Design
Tests ensure dropdown works across all device sizes:
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Proper touch interactions
- Consistent styling across viewports

### Usage

Run all dropdown tests:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/dropdown-functionality.spec.ts
```

Run specific test:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/dropdown-functionality.spec.ts -g "validate dropdown structure"
```

Run with UI mode:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/dropdown-functionality.spec.ts --ui
```

### Screenshots

Test screenshots are automatically saved to:
- `tests/screenshots/dropdown-functionality-test.png`
- Test failure screenshots in `test-results/` directory

This consolidated approach provides comprehensive coverage while eliminating redundancy and improving maintainability.
